People of Design,

Throughout 2020 I am doing a project focussed on sharing career stories from across the design industry.
For this project I want to focus on people who came to the field of design in some lateral way, or perhaps later in life; folk who never went to design school, or those who switched professions to pursue a career in design.

I’m looking for people from any branch of design, wherever you are on the art / creative / marketing / content / software / product / interaction / service end of the spectrum, or even beyond. If you have a stake in what a thing will look, feel or work like, you are welcome!

I want to hear how you landed that first design job, and what moved you to get into design in the first place. I want to know what it felt like, trying to make the jump. I want to hear about your struggles finding your feet, your biggest challenges, happiest successes and meanest setbacks along the way. And now that you’re here, I want to hear why you stay in our industry, what keeps your passion up.

### Why am I doing this project?
I have three main goals:
- I want to highlight the rich contribution that folk coming from alternative career paths make to the field of design & tech
- I also want to demystify design as a career choice and help people see that there are many different ways to make a big contribution in design
- And finally, I want to bring attention to the breadth of experiences and diverse backgrounds we come into this field from, the stories that are often underrepresented in the industry narrative

As someone who passionately side-stepped into design myself, I’m looking forward to swapping war stories and hearing about what got you excited about this field, to take the huge leap of a career change.

### How to be part of it?

It’s simple:

- If you fit this description, please consider being part of this project! Sharing your story will help many future hopeful designers in ways you can’t even think of. Just [respond using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePfikEjU6Cuz-Ro8UKtnEJ0jlMvWMk8dgef-Iv5B5l5ucucQ/viewform).
- Please nominate people you know who have these kinds of stories to share about their career path. Simply forward this call to them and if they are interested, they can [respond using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePfikEjU6Cuz-Ro8UKtnEJ0jlMvWMk8dgef-Iv5B5l5ucucQ/viewform).

Practically speaking, I’m asking for an hour of your time over a video call, and the permission to publish the chat in a written form on the project website. (You will get to review it before it is published.) I’d also love to include images and links back to your work & socials, if you’d like that.

### What happens next?

Initially I’m looking for about 80 participants, with the first 10 people selected and contacted by mid-February 2020.

Initially I will focus on covering the widest breadth of experiences possible, and select subjects accordingly. However, I do hope that this will become an ongoing project so everyone who applies can be covered.

Please share this far and wide to your friends and colleagues — the more people this reaches outside of my network, the better the project will be.


Thanks and speak soon!
Zita
