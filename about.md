Lateral Stories in Design is a collection of interviews sharing the stories of people who came into the Design industry from a different career.

The project has three main goals:
- To highlight the rich contribution that folk coming from alternative career paths make to the field of design & tech
- To demystify design as a career choice and help people see that there are many different ways to make a big contribution in design
- And finally, to bring attention to the breadth of experiences and diverse backgrounds we come into this field from, the stories that are often underrepresented in the industry narrative

### Team
Lateral Stories was started in November 2019 by Scotland based designer [Zita Orb√°n](#).

This website was brought to life with ample help from [Anda Popovici](#).
