People of Design,

I need your help creating a place to share career stories from across the design industry.

I especially want to focus on stories of people who came to the field of design in some lateral way, or perhaps later in life: folk who never went to design school, or those who switched professions to pursue a career in design. 

### Can YOU help?

If you fit the above description, please consider being part of this project! All it involves is sharing your career story which will be published on this site in an interview format.

People from any branch of design are welcome, wherever you are on the art / creative / marketing / content / software / product / interaction / service end of the spectrum, or even beyond. 

If you have a stake in what a thing will look, feel or work like, you are welcome!


### How to be part of it?

It’s simple:

- If you fit this description, please do get in touch! Sharing your story will help many future hopeful designers in ways you can’t even think of. Just [respond using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePfikEjU6Cuz-Ro8UKtnEJ0jlMvWMk8dgef-Iv5B5l5ucucQ/viewform).
- Please nominate people you know who have these kinds of stories to share about their career path. Simply forward this call to them and if they are interested, they can [respond using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePfikEjU6Cuz-Ro8UKtnEJ0jlMvWMk8dgef-Iv5B5l5ucucQ/viewform).


### What to expect

I'll want to hear how you landed that first design job, and what moved you to get into design in the first place. I want to know what it felt like, trying to take the jump into design. I want to hear about your struggles finding your feet, your biggest challenges, happiest successes and meanest setbacks along the way. And now that you’re here, I want to hear why you stay in our industry, what keeps you going and enthusiastic about design.

As someone who passionately side-stepped into design myself, I’m looking forward to swapping war stories and hearing about what got you excited about this field, to take the huge leap of a career change.

Practically speaking, I’m asking for an hour of your time over a video call, and the permission to publish the chat in a written form on the project website. (You will get to review it before it is published.) I’d also love to include images and links back to your work & socials, if you’d like that.

Please share this far and wide to your friends and colleagues — the more people this reaches outside of my network, the better the project will be.


Thanks and speak soon!
Zita
