Lateral Stories is a collection of interviews, sharing the journeys of people who came into the Design industry from a different career.
{:.lead}

It is an ongoing passion project initially focusing on the Design industry, but in the longer term it aims to share stories from across the entire gamut of career change.

My goal is to show, through these stories, that switching careers is not taboo, and neither is it black magic. Embracing career change opens up professions to people from more varied backgrounds, with more diverse perspectives and better ideas. 

Ultimately I believe that changing careers is an enriching life experience and want to research and better understand what skills and strategies help people make the jump from one field of expertise to another. 

My hope is that through this project, we will all learn about career change together.\

## Meet the host
Hello, I'm [Zita](#) of [Lateral &co](#): a 2009 Computer Science graduate who followed her passion into full time UX/Product Design roles in 2014 and never looked back. You can [read my career change story here]({% post_url 2020-03-14-zita %}), if you're interested.

Since late 2018 I have been moonlighting as a volunteer Design Coach at a coding bootcamp, as well as mentoring colleagues and friends who hoped to become Designers.

I discovered that masses of people want to get into Design, but they are held back by all sorts of myths and fears about what it takes to land their first job in the field. For many, this career change feels like an insurmountable challenge, despite having excellent skills and aptitudes that would help them succeed in the job. 

What I learned along the way, supporting my mentees, is that careers are not necessarily linear like we're told and people who switch careers invariably bring unique skills with them from their previous lives, representing incredible value to their new chosen industry.

I created this interview series to bring more visibility to career change stories and give people the courage and tools to make the jump they dream of. 

Hope youâ€™ll join me in helping give a leg up to a new, more diverse generation of Designers through sharing your own story.
